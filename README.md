# No Youtube script
no-youtube is a script to replace youtube links to invidio.us

## About
This script exists with the purpose of avoiding the use of Google's services, but still being able to see videos hosted on YouTube from another platform with greater privacy.
To facilitate this, it has created a script that prevents access to the links to YouTube, opening the content on the web invidio.us

## Installation
To use this script it is necessary to have an userscript administrator.
If you use Mozilla Firefox, you can use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/" target="_blank">Greasemonkey</a> addon. 

If you use Google Chrome, you can use  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl" target="_blank">Tampermonkey</a>.

Once we have the script manager, simply copy and paste the .js to a new user script in the addon.
